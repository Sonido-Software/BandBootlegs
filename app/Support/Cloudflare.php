 * Production (bandbootlegs.com) sits behind Cloudflare, so every
 * request reaches the server from one of Cloudflare's addresses. Trusting
 * these (and only these) lets Laravel read the visitor's real IP from
 * X-Forwarded-For (the login rate limit relies on it) and see https, so
 * signed URLs and generated links match what the visitor used.
 * Trusting every proxy instead would let anyone who reached the server
 * directly fake their IP. Same list as gigwithme's, akmusic's and commandcenter's.
 *
 * From https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/ (checked September 2026; the list
 * changes rarely). Update it here if Cloudflare announces new ranges.
